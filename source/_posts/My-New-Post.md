Migration Guide
Some of the built-in tags have been dropped (E.g. gist, youtube, jsfiddle, and vimeo). If you use those tags in your existing blog posts, you can install hexo-tag-embed to continue using them with Hexo 7.0.0.

Note

No need to install it if you are not using (or will not use) gist, youtube, jsfiddle, vimeo tags in your post or page.

$ npm i hexo-tag-embed
